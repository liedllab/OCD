    This function compares the residues found in the sample and the reference structure after the atom mask was applied.
    If reference structure and traj have a different amount of atoms, we assume this to be due to missing residues.
    Therefore, we generate a new mask corresponding to only the residues shared between them. This goes off the residue names in the pdb files.
    Note that this won't work correctly with trajectories, as the residues there are just renumbered to start from 1 in all cases.
    
    Parameters:
    -----
    Requires:

def standard_orientation(stripped_domains, mask_A, mask_B, out):

    Calculates standard orientation for two domains given as masks A and B applied to trajectory traj. 
    Standard orientations are calculated as the orientation where the lowest moment of inertia eigenvector of the domain is aligned with z, the x axis is as close to the vector bewtween the centers of mass of the two domains as possible.
    The y vector is calculated as the negative crossproduct of the z-vector (lowest eigenvector) and x-vector(projection of com vector), giving a right handed coordinate system.
    The whole domain is alligned to this coordinate system in such a way that the center of mass is in the origin.
    The coordinates of the two alligned domains are returned.
    
    The full reference structure is used for the calculation of the coordinate system, but the coordinates are stripped before output according to masks A/B -> coordinate system only dependant on refstructure, not on the necessary mask for further alignment
    This is necessary, because crystal structure files might contain fewer residues than the reference structure which would mess up the alignment
